/**
 * @brief This class analyzes the readings from the block sensors in order to monitor the number of passages through the doorway
 *
 * Analysis assumes that the vector of sensors is ordered such that the first sensor if the outermost sensor in the gateway.
 * That is, an object passing inward through the gateway will pass the sensors in the same order that the sensors are present
 * in the vector.
 *
 * The class begins creates a digital data stream for each sensor by periodically sampling their values. No analysis of the data is 
 * made until the monitoring session is complete. At the end of the monitoring session, the streams are smoothed and refined.
 *
 * The class then steps through the streams, identifying peaks in the data, and identifying matching peaks across the data streams.
 * From this, the class determines the number of passages through the doorway and the probable direction of each passage.
 *
 * update() is intended to be called periodically within some loop by the controlling class. update() must be called periodically 
 * during the monitoring session for proper data gathering to occur. Calling update() outside of the monitoring session is unnecessary,
 * but doind so will not result in any adverse behavior.
 *
 * A monitoring session is started with startMonitoringSession(). This initializes the data and begins the data collection process. 
 * No data will be sampled from the sensors until the monitoring session is initialized with startMonitoringSession().
 *
 * A monitoring session is ended with endMonitoringSession(). This ends the collection of data, and performs analyis on the collected data.
 *
 * getResults() will return a PassageTriple containing the identified passages from the last monitoring session. getResults() should only be called 
 * after the monitoring session has been ended with endMonitoringSession(), otherwise getResults() will report incomplete data.
